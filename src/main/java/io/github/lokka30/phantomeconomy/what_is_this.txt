PhantomEconomy v2.0.0 is an in-development version which will completely transform the plugin into what I actually wanted it to become to begin with. It will contain a plethora of new features and will hopefully have less bugs and more smiles.

Here's a list of planned features, improvements and fixes over v1:
========================================================================
1. MySQL and SQLite database storage
   MySQL allows servers to sync all or specific account types' balances to each other
   Example setup: Only Skywars and Bedwars share the same PlayerAccount and BankAccount balances, but the whole network share the same NonPlayerAccount balances.
2. Unlimited user-configurable currencies
3. Even better settings file
4. Fully cached balances and configuration files for much better performance
5. Full non-player account support (Towny, etc)
6. Full bank account support (mainly for Vault)
7. API for other developers
8. PlaceholderAPI placeholders for scoreboards, etc
9. No longer Vault-dependent
10. General code improvements
11. New baltop system
12. Import from Essentials Economy
13. Reliance on PhantomLib
14. Several more minor things..
- Command to give money to all online and/or offline players
- Server total in baltop
- Customisable 'console added $x to your account' message
- Transaction log
- [balance] sign
- Configurable repeating task which clears caches of accounts
========================================================================


Can I test it early?
========================================================================
- Yep, you can. You assume all responsibility for any errors or damages caused. v2 is strictly in development and is by no means ready for installation on a server that has too much to lose.
- The database commands haven't been tested at all yet, so make sure you backup or make a new database for testing.
- Instructions -- if you don't want to follow them, ask lokka30 to make you a jar :)
  1. If you aren't compiling the plugin: open the latest jar file from Spigot with WinRar, 7-Zip or another suitable program that can open up jar files and view and edit its contents.
  2. delete all resource files (plugin.yml, settings.yml, messages.yml, data.json) that aren't in the v2 folder. If you are compiling the plugin then this is located in the /src/resources/ folder.
  2. Move all of the contents of the v2 folder into the parent directory. Delete the v2 folder once complete. You should have v2's plugin.yml, settings.yml and messages.yml now.
  3. In the plugin.yml file, in the 'main' setting, change it from 'io.github.lokka30.phantomeconomy.PhantomEconomy' to 'io.github.lokka30.phantomeconomy_v2.PhantomEconomy'.
  4. Save the plugin.yml file and compile/save the jar file.

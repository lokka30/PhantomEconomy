PhantomEconomy v2.0.0 is an in-development version which will completely transform the plugin into what I actually wanted it to become to begin with. It will contain a plethora of new features and will hopefully have less bugs and more smiles.

Here's a list of planned features, improvements and fixes over v1:
========================================================================
1. MySQL and SQLite database storage
   MySQL allows servers to sync all or specific account types' balances to each other
   Example setup: Only Skywars and Bedwars share the same PlayerAccount and BankAccount balances, but the whole network share the same NonPlayerAccount balances.
2. Unlimited user-configurable currencies
3. Even better settings file
4. Fully cached balances and configuration files for much better performance
5. Full non-player account support (Towny, etc)
6. Full bank account support (mainly for Vault)
7. API for other developers
8. PlaceholderAPI placeholders for scoreboards, etc
9. No longer Vault-dependent
10. General code improvements
11. New baltop system
12. Import from Essentials Economy
13. Reliance on PhantomLib
14. Several more minor things..
- Command to give money to all online and/or offline players
- Server total in baltop
- Customisable 'console added $x to your account' message
- Transaction log
- [balance] sign
- Configurable repeating task which clears caches of accounts
========================================================================


Can I test it early?
========================================================================
- Yep, you can. You assume all responsibility for any errors or damages caused. v2 is strictly in development and is by no means ready for installation on a server that has too much to lose.
- Simply head to the 'developer logs spam' chat on my Discord server and find the latest pre release jar there.

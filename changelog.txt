changes:
 - new config section 'currency-format'.

 - better vault implementation.
  - fixes [#6]: formtted balance returning null

updated:
- updated file library


1.4-RELEASE:
file changes:
 - settings.yml - now version 3 - [link]
 - messages.yml - now version 2 - [link]

notes:
 - data.yml hasn't changed in structure, but player balances are now stored to a rounded format.
 - It is recommended you reset the file if you can so old balances will be rounded.
 - As players make transactions, their old balance will become rounded though.
 - Thus I didn't update the data.json version :)

changes:
 - [issue #7, #8, #5] redone a massive portion of the plugin. everything except for the main class and utility classes have been scrapped and redone.
  - plugin is now fully dependent on Vault. It's a great API so I decided it couldn't hurt to become dependent on it.
  - completely changed the settings.yml and messages.yml file.
   - the files have changed from the ground up. they're filled to the brim with comments, so I doubt you'll ever get confused of what an option does.
   - you can now use both a symbol and a word in currency formatting.
 - after a high demand and long wait, I have added in /pay and /baltop
  - usages:
   - /pay <player> <amount>
   - /baltop
 - after an extreme demand, including one from the Trump administration, I have added in /phantomeconomy. This revolutionary command shows you the version of the plugin you have installed.


1.5-RELEASE:
file changes:
 - messages.yml
  - Now version 3
  - Added message for users trying to pay themselves (located at 'commands.pay.pay-self')

notes:
 - Not Tested!
 - Performance optimisation: When a player's balance is requested, it will prefer looking up the cached value. This will improve performance over checking the data file.
 - Removed 'PlaceholderAPI' soft dependency until the baltop placeholder is added.
 - Users can't pay themselves anymore. The bank got sick of those useless transactions!
 - Updated libraries (LightningStorage 3.0.7 -> 3.0.9)




1.6-RELEASE:
file changes: none
changes:
- Not Tested!
- Merged PR from Dkbay: Fixed warning on baltop update when there are no players in the baltop.
- Added debugging to hasAccount as it seems to be causing a few users issues about 'the player hasn't played before'.
- fixed /pay command sending message 'received' to sender instead of target




1.7-RELEASE:
file changes:
- none

changes:
- Fixed balances not being loaded properly when users join (thanks CACGaming)
- Reverted back to old baltop code, fixed the annoying 'Long cannot be cast to class' issue in the console.
